## Java Design Patterns

This repository is make for to study the Design Patterns in Java language.Each of the package contain one pattern

### Creational Patterns.
- **Singleton:** This package contains the Singleton Connection class, in which the pattern is applied so that it can only be instantiated once time. The counter property is added only as a validator of what is happening
- **Factory Method:** This package contains a service interface that is implemented by the classes inside the services_concrete package, with which the required service class can be instantiated. The ServiceFactory is responsible for receiving a request for the type of service that is required through the TypeService, with which it instantiates the corresponding service class. This is a slightly different implementation from the original, making the Factory class a concrete class instead of being abstract, and in it, by means of an enum, the creation of the correct service is decided. In the original way, for every concrete class of service, there should be a concrete factory class that instantiates that service. The problem with this implementation is that it is much better than ours if the application has a dependency injection service, since if it does not, the instantiation is done directly in the client, causing it to have dependencies with classes such as services. If you have to add a new service class to our implementation, you only have to create the corresponding concrete service class, extend it from the service interface and add the case to the factory switch with the new instantiation.
- **Builder:** this pattern, a "Personal Computer" class was created with a constructor that requires 6 arguments in a specific order. To reduce complexity, we have created a "Personal Computer Builder" class with properties defined by default, and each set of methods return Personal Computer Builder to concatenate other methods and finally close with the method construct that returns the Personal Computer class. In this way we have no problem with the order of the arguments.
- **Prototype:** This pattern looks for the responsibility of creating a copy of an object to fall directly on the object to be copied instead of the constructor class, avoiding that dependency. It can be achieved by generating an interface with a clone method that returns an object from this same interface and is implemented in the class that creates the object that we want to clone.
